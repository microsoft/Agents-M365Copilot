# Microsoft 365 Copilot APIs Client Libraries

The Microsoft 365 Copilot APIs client libraries are designed to facilitate the development of high-quality, efficient, and resilient AI solutions that access the [Copilot APIs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/copilot-apis-overview). These libraries include service and core libraries.

The service libraries offer models and request builders that provide a rich, typed experience for working with Microsoft 365 Copilot APIs.

The core libraries offer advanced features to facilitate interactions with the Copilot APIs. These features include embedded support for retry handling, secure redirects, transparent authentication, and payload compression. These capabilities help you enhance the quality of your AI solution's communications with the Copilot APIs without adding complexity. Additionally, the core libraries simplify routine tasks such as paging through collections and creating batch requests.
